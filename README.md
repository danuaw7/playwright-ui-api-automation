## ⚠️ Known Issue Screenshot on UI Automation
Evidence: https://imgur.com/x0WqGjm

> ⚠️ **Skipping this step due to a known issue:**  
> The #countries dropdown (`<select id="countries">`)  is currently not selectable manually or via automation.
As a result, I cannot proceed with full form submission, and automation is intentionally stopped before submitting the form.
